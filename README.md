# Download_Tools
This code library is primarily intended to back up some small functions related to data downloading and processing, as I frequently find myself repeating certain pieces of code, which is a waste of time. Please feel free to use it.
 
### 1. The Music21 directory is used to download the music dataset from YouTube. Great thanks to the repository: ![MUSIC_dataset](https://github.com/roudimit/MUSIC_dataset) 
```
python music_download.py

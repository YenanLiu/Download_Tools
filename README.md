# Download_Tools
This code library is primarily intended to back up some small functions related to data downloading and processing. I frequently find myself repeating certain pieces of code, which wastes time. Please feel free to use it.
 
### 1. Download [MUSIC_dataset](https://github.com/roudimit/MUSIC_dataset) 

The Music21 directory is used to download the music dataset from YouTube. 
```
python music_download.py
